Log and view all outgoing emails from WordPress. Works with WordPress Multisite as well.

## Description ##

Email Log is a WordPress plugin that allows you to easily log and view all emails sent from WordPress.
This would be very useful for debugging email related problems in your WordPress site or for storing sent emails for auditing purposes.

You can perform advanced actions like re-sending email, automatically forwarding emails or export logs with our [premium add-ons](https://wpemaillog.com/store/?utm_campaign=Upsell&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=readme&utm_content=store).

### Viewing logged emails

The logged emails will be stored in a separate table and can be viewed from the admin interface.
While viewing the logs, the emails can be filtered or sorted based on the date, email, subject etc.

### Deleting logged emails

In the admin interface, all the logged emails can be delete in bulk or can also be selectively deleted based on date, email and subject.

### Resend email (Pro addon)

You can [buy the Resend email pro add-on](https://wpemaillog.com/addons/resend-email/?utm_campaign=Upsell&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=readme&utm_content=re),
which allows you to resend the email directly from the email log.
The add-on allows you to modify the different fields before resending the email.

### More Fields (Pro addon)

You can [buy the More Fields pro add-on](https://wpemaillog.com/addons/more-fields/?utm_campaign=Upsell&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=readme&utm_content=mf),
which shows additional fields in the email log page. The following are the additional fields that are added by this addon.

- From
- CC
- BCC
- Reply To
- Attachment

### Forward email (Pro addon)

You can [buy the Forward email pro add-on](https://wpemaillog.com/addons/more-fields/?utm_campaign=Upsell&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=readme&utm_content=fe),
which allows you to send a copy of all the emails send from WordPress, to another email address.
The addon allows you to choose whether you want to forward through to, cc or bcc fields.
This can be extremely useful when you want to debug by analyzing the emails that are sent from WordPress.

### Cleaning up db on uninstall

As [recommended by Ozh][1], the Plugin has an uninstall hook which will clean up the database when the Plugin is uninstalled.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### The content of the email is not getting logged when I am using wpmandrill plugin

wpmandrill plugin has a bug that prevents this plugin from logging the content of the email.
More details about the bug is available at http://wordpress.org/support/topic/mandrill-is-changing-the-names-of-args-in-the-filter?replies=1.
I have asked the author of the plugin to fix it and it might get fixed it the next release.
Meanwhile, I have added a hack to handle this condition in v1.7.3 of my plugin. So if the content is not getting logged, then upgrade to v1.7.3.
